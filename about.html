  <section class="about-story reveal delay-2">
    <h2>The Journey</h2>


<p>
  Ashok Prajapati began his journey with art, developing strong skills in
  drawing, sketching, and painting. Over time, his passion for art naturally
  expanded into commercial painting, where the same discipline, patience,
  and attention to detail were applied on a larger scale.
</p>

<p>
  While commercial painting projects often involve teamwork, all artistic
  works are personally created by him. This distinction allows him to
  maintain full creative control over his art, while efficiently managing
  larger residential and commercial painting projects.
</p>

<p>
  Whether working on a single artwork or overseeing a complete painting
  project, every task is approached with responsibility, care, and respect
  for the craft.
